# 🎓 Semester 4 Projects – Cybersecurity & Systems Development

This repository contains a curated collection of assignments, labs, and projects completed during my **4th semester** in university. It reflects practical learning across **Operating Systems**, **Cybersecurity**, **Networking**, and **Software Development** using C, Python, Bash, Node.js, and various industry-standard tools.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- ✅ Inter-Process Communication (Pipes, FIFOs, Signals)
- ✅ File Handling & Logging in Linux
- ✅ System Calls in C (Fork, Exec, etc.)
- ✅ Client-Server Architecture in Python (Sockets, Threads)
- ✅ Intrusion Detection & Suspicious Activity Monitoring
- ✅ Network Security Concepts (Port Knocking, MITM)
- ✅ Pentesting Techniques (LFI, HSTS misconfig, payload crafting)
- ✅ Static Vulnerability Analysis (Node.js apps)
- ✅ Automation with Bash scripting
- ✅ Git & Version Control for codebases

## 📊 Highlights

- Developed a **Python Backup System** with DB integration, multi-user management
- Built a **Port Knocking Security System** with real-time logging
- Created **MITM injectors and LFI scanners** for pentesting simulations
- Automated **log analysis** for suspicious activity using Linux logs
- Applied **dependency scanning** tools and evaluated vulnerable applications

## 🧠 Mindset

> "I don’t just complete assignments. I explore the deeper purpose behind every project — how it can be secured, optimized, and turned into something impactful."

This repo is only **5%** of the actual work done this semester. Due to time constraints and project size, only essential folders and working code have been pushed.
